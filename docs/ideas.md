Innovative Idea
This is a website where the user can upload, once a day, a picture of their outfit along with a description of where they got each piece of their outfit and the total price of their outfit. Then there is a rating system that allows the user and other users to rate the outfit. Then the user can also go on their feed and view other peopleâ€™s outfits. This application is similar to how any social media works with uploading on a feed, but we are focusing on the outfits mainly so we will only have a rating system instead of likes and comments. This is a fusion between a clothing store and a social media network.

Important Components
Users will be able to login to their profile where they can upload their fit as well as see their scores for the day. Users can upload a picture of their fit and describe every piece of their clothing. Other users can review other users' fits and rate them with a scale of 1-10. Each clothing piece will have its own description with where to buy it, what it's called and how it feels on the person uploading the clothing piece.
