Users are created with a username, first and last names, email, and password at Sign up
Login calls the user API and ensures that the user exists, and if so sends it to the website's feed.
Feed calls the pictures API and gets all pictures stored in the database and displays it to the user.
Users can also direct to their profile, which calls the user API which returns personal information, as well as the picture API to retrieve pictures uplaoded by the user
